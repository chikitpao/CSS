Usage
------------
- calculate_sum_subsets.py
    * **calcluate_sum_subsets_linear(n, div)**: Use matrix multiplications to calculate number of sums of subsets of n numbers modulo div. Return a dx1-matrix with count of sums congruent to (0, 1, ...) modulo d.
    * **calcluate_sum_subsets_logarithmic(n, div)**: Like calcluate_sum_subsets_linear, but only has logarithmic complexity instead of linear. Return a dx1-matrix with count of sums congruent to (0, 1, ...) modulo d.
    * **calcluate_sum_subsets_constant(n, div, sum_subset_formulas: SumSubsetsFormulas)**: Use formulas to calculate number of sums of subsets of n numbers modulo div. Return a dx1-matrix with count of sums congruent to (0, 1, ...) modulo d. Needs an object of class SumSubsetsFormulas. Throws ValueError if d is not supported (supports d from 2 to 100).
- calcluate_sum_subsets_cs.py
    * **calcluate_sum_subsets_cs(n, div, debug=False)**: Use cyclic sieving on a generating function to calculate number of sums of subsets of n numbers modulo div. Return a dx1-matrix with count of sums congruent to (0, 1, ...) modulo d. With parameter **debug** is set to True, additional information is shown to the output which is helpful if you want to create formulas for calculation :-).
    * **calcluate_sum_subsets_gcd(n, div)**: Like calcluate_sum_subsets_cs, but is much faster by replacing the most polynomial multiplications with evaluation of behavior regarding roots of unity.

**CAUTION:** calculation will take longer with larger d. It might be caused by calculation with large matrices. For function **calcluate_sum_subsets_cs**, I have to elminiate roots in polynoimal myself since SymPy seems to be unable to eliminate roots in sum. These are calculation times of function **calcluate_sum_subsets_cs** with n = 2000:
* d = 5: time = 0.063 s
* d = 10: time = 0.12 s
* d = 15: time = 0.4 s
* d = 20: time = 1.0 s
* d = 25: time = 2.1 s
* d = 50: time = 64 s
